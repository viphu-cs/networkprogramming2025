WEEK 1 – BASIC: Client–Server Communication (TCP Unicast)

Teaching Intent (Instructor Note)
Week 1 is about protocol obedience. Students must feel TCP’s discipline: listen before talk, connect before speak, close when finished. No shortcuts, no abstractions.

Overview
This lab introduces socket programming through the most fundamental network model: client–server communication. One side listens. One side asks. Nobody panics.

Learning Outcome / Trait Assessment
Understand TCP client–server architecture
Implement blocking socket communication
Relate TCP reliability to application behavior
Traits trained: - Structured thinking - Protocol discipline - Debugging network state

Key Concepts
TCP sockets
bind(), listen(), accept(), connect()
Request–response pattern
Blocking I/O behavior

BASIC LAB — Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 0: Shared Configuration
# config.py
HOST = "127.0.0.1"  # loopback
PORT = 5000
BUFFER_SIZE = 1024

Step 1–3: Create, Bind, and Listen (Server)
# server.py
import socket
from config import HOST, PORT, BUFFER_SIZE

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
server_socket.listen(1)

print(f"[SERVER] Listening on {HOST}:{PORT}")

Step 4: Accept a Client Connection
conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
print(f"[SERVER] Connection from {addr}")

Step 5–6: Receive Data and Send Response
data = conn.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)
message = data.decode()
print(f"[SERVER] Received: {message}")

reply = f"ACK: {message}"
conn.sendall(reply.encode())

Step 7: Close the Connection
conn.close()
server_socket.close()
print("[SERVER] Closed connection")

Client Implementation
# client.py
import socket
from config import HOST, PORT, BUFFER_SIZE

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((HOST, PORT))

message = "Hello Server"
client_socket.sendall(message.encode())

response = client_socket.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)
print(f"[CLIENT] Received: {response.decode()}")

client_socket.close()

Execution & Verification
Terminal 1: python server.py
Terminal 2: python client.py
Observe ACK message
Modify message content and repeat

Expected Output
Client sends text → Server responds with acknowledgment

Common Mistakes (and Why They Matter)
Missing listen() → server violates TCP ritual
Port already in use → OS-level resource contention
recv() blocks forever → protocol deadlock

BASIC EXTENSION OPTIONS (Same Repo, New Branches)
Extension A: Sequential Multiple Clients
Wrap accept() in a loop
Server stays alive
Extension B: Message Validation
Reject empty messages
Enforce message length
Extension C: Timeout Handling
Set socket timeout
Handle unresponsive peers

EXTRA LAB — ADVANCED: Mini Chat Server
Purpose
Introduce state, repetition, and responsibility while staying inside TCP.

Advanced Requirements
Server runs indefinitely
Handles multiple clients sequentially or via threads
Logs all messages with timestamps
Clean disconnect handling

Advanced Concepts Introduced
Server lifecycle management
Basic concurrency (threading)
Application-layer protocol design

Real-World Mapping
Call centers
Customer support systems
Ticketing backends

Forward Application Hooks
This lab becomes the foundation for: - Week 2: UDP contrast (no ACKs) - Week 5: Peer-to-peer nodes - Week 7: Store-and-forward servers - Security labs (auth, TLS, zero trust)

Instructor Truth
If students rush past Week 1, every future lab will collapse quietly.

EXTRA LAB: Mini Chat Server
Scenario: Build a helpdesk chat server where multiple clients can connect sequentially.
Real-world mapping: Call centers, ticketing systems
